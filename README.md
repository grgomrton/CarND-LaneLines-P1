#**Finding Lane Lines on the Road - Assignment Entry**
This repository contains my solution for the Finding Lane Lines assignment in the Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program at Udacity.

### Building the environment
- Download and install the [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)
- Clone this repository

### Executing the pipeline

- Switch to _carnd-term1_ environment and start Jupyter:  
  `$ source activate carnd-term1`  
  `$ cd ~/CarND-LaneLines-P1`  
  `$ jupyter notebook`  
- Navigate to `http://localhost:8888/`, open the _P1_ notebook and click on `Kernel / Restart & Run all`
- The pipeline should execute on the test images, the input videos and on the challenge video
